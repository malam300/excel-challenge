Given the proven data, we can conclude that 
1) The best method of crowdfunding was through the theater, plays to be specific.
2) Film and video was also a good choice as it had the second most successful campaigns.
3) Music had the third most successful campaign showing it can also be a viable campaign option.

Some limitations the dataset had was age and gender, depending on who came to what event would have mattered, theaters are generally advertised to elder folks while the category technology asnd web may be more inclined to the younger generation, thus influincing the actual campaign.  

In the future we can maybe create graphs relating to how donations were made, wether it was through cash, credit card or cheques. This may influence donors to either donate or not donate, based on what method of payment is available.
